# Mana

Mana is a proof-of-concept in-browser implementation of Magic the Gathering(tm) card game using EventMachine, Sinatra, Compass and Websockets.


## Demo

Try it yourself!

http://83.167.232.160/games/any-name

and replace 'any-name' by a name of your choice. Send the URL to your friend(s) and play! The controls are very simple:

 - drag & drop does most of the actions
 - left click shows the detail
 - CTRL + left click covers/uncovers a card
 - right click taps/untaps the card

## Contributions

All contributions are welcomed. The graphics needs rework (right now it is in-fact "borrowed" from http://tappedout.net), Tests has to be written and a lot of features are easy to implement but they are not there yet. Just for the repository and send the pull-requests or write me a message on Github.

## Requirements

Webkit-based browser (developed in Chrome).

## TODO

 - searching library
 - putting cards to library
 - lobby synchronization
 - shuffle trigger
 - counters
 - tokens
 - simple chat
 - each user has its own color
 - security
